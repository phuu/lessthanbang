It's a new year. We're all busy battling our inboxes, hangovers and trying to budge that chocolate-induced weight we all gained so, for the benfit of all, we'll cut out the bollocks.

Two [young](//twitter.com/phuunet) & [attractive](//twitter.com/PaulAdamDavis) web people (who actually write code on a daily basis to *earn a living*) from the ‘sunny’ UK are starting a podcast!

We'll talk about code, life, hot social drama and other things of all varieties, and do our best to have a guest on most shows too, especially fresh thoughts from people you probably should know.

* We're going to do an episode twice a month, more often if things go well.
* We're recording with good equipment, not just iPhone headsets. It won't be painful to listen to.
* We aren't going to filter what we really want to say, and we will swear.

We have wanted to do this for a long time and we'll will give this our all to make it the best we can. There's been a few podcasts pop up of late but believe us, this has been a long time in the planning.
